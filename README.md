# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
The aim of this lab task is to comprehensively demonstrate the UX design process through combined scenarios, focusing on improving the hospital appointment booking experience. This project integrates five critical UX methodologies to understand, ideate, and design solutions for a complex real-world problem.

To create user stories based on personas and their goals using the standard "As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]" format
To develop detailed narrative scenarios that describe users in context, including emotional states, tasks, and environment
To design task flow diagrams using standard symbols (start, decision, action) for common user journeys
To perform information architecture tasks including card sorting exercises and create site maps showing categorized structure
